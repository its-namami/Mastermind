A logical guessing CLI game

## Features

## Description

Welcome to the Mastermind Game!

Game Rules:
- The Codemaker has selected a secret sequence of 4 colors.
- You have up to 8 rounds to guess this sequence.
- After each guess, the Codemaker will give you feedback:
* "black" indicates a correct color in the correct position.
* No feedback or other indicators means your guess has no correct colors or positions.
- Use the feedback to improve your next guess.
- There are 6 available colors.

How to Play:
- In each round, you will be asked to input a sequence of 4 colors.
- Enter each color one by one when prompted.
- Make sure to only input from the available colors.
- Try to guess the exact sequence before the rounds run out.

Good luck and have fun!
